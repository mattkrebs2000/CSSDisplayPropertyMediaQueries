1. git clone https://github.com/mattkrebs2000/CSSDisplayPropertyMediaQueries.git

2. cd into CSSDisplayPropertyMediaQueries

3. Use Live Server to see the result of the code.

4. Change the Screen width and notice that when the screen width is between 700 and 900 has some styling. 

5. This is a result of the Media Queries which have helped to limit when the code gets applied. In its starting form there is a Media Query that gets applied when the  screen width is between 700-800 and an additional Media Query that gets applied when the  screen width is between 800-900. 

6. The goal for this assignment is to make it so there are an additional 7 Media Queries each with a different set of CSS that will get applied. The sections should be as follows: 

  A. Block without any alignment (< 600)
  B. Block with align TextAlgin: right(600-700)
  C. Block With Centering (700-800)
  D. Inline Block without Text Align (800-900)
  E. Inline BLock with TextAlign:right (900-1000)
  F. Inline Block with TextAlign:center (1000-1100)
  G. No Display property - use Float:Right (1100-1200)
  H. No Display property - use Float:Left (> 1200)

7. Parts C and D are almost complete: You just have to change it so the place that says (for example) "This is where your explanation for 'InLine Block' goes" gets changed. In that space you have to make sure it says what Inline Block does and how it is naturally getting aligned. 

8. To do this properly you will have to add to the HTML and to the CSS. To the HTML you will have to add new lines below the lines where it says 'class="one"' and adding new lines that will show up (by using and then taking away 'display:none') when it is appropriate based on the screen width. 

9. In the end, your final product should be styled based on A-H depending on the width of the browser. Save your work to your own github folder and pass in a link.
